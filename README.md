# **Contract Evolution Manager**

## **Domain**: Legal

### **Problem Statement**
Legal teams often need to track multiple versions of contracts, agreements, and amendments. Without version control, managing revisions becomes inefficient, and there's a risk of using the wrong version of a contract.

### **Challenges**
- **Managing Numerous Drafts**: Legal documents are often revised multiple times, making it difficult to manage and track every draft.
- **Risk of Using Outdated Versions**: Without version control, there is a risk of relying on outdated contract versions.
- **Difficulty in Comparing Versions**: Legal teams often struggle to quickly compare changes between different drafts of contracts.

### **Solution Overview**
Implement **S3 Versioning** to automatically track every version of contracts and legal documents. This ensures that legal teams always have access to the most recent version and can compare changes across drafts.

### **How It Solves the Problem**
By enabling versioning, the system ensures that every contract draft is saved and easily retrievable, reducing the risk of confusion and ensuring that teams always work with the latest version.

## **How We Will Solve the Problems**

1. **Enable S3 Versioning**: Store contracts and legal documents in S3 with versioning enabled.
2. **Track Updates**: Whenever a document is modified, a new version will be created automatically.
3. **Compare Contract Versions**: Provide tools for legal teams to compare changes between different versions.

---

## **Features**
- **Version Control for Contracts**: Automatically track every version of contracts and legal documents.
- **Version Comparison**: Tools for comparing changes between different drafts.
- **Metadata Tracking**: Track essential metadata such as author, revision number, and approval status.

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Store Contracts in S3**: Legal documents are stored in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled.
2. **Track Changes**: Any time a document is updated, it will generate a new version.
3. **Compare Versions**: Legal teams can use a user interface to compare versions, view changes, and track document evolution.

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/contract-evolution-manager.git
cd contract-evolution-manager
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 2: Enable S3 Versioning**

Run the `enable_versioning.py` script to enable versioning for your S3 bucket.

```bash
python enable_versioning.py
```

### **Step 3: Upload Contract**

To upload a new contract, run the `upload_contract.py` script. This will upload the contract and store metadata such as author, revision number, and approval status.

```bash
python upload_contract.py
```

### **Step 4: List and Compare Versions**

To list and compare different versions of a contract, use the `list_versions.py` script.

```bash
python list_versions.py
```

### **Step 5: Retrieve a Specific Version**

If you need to retrieve a specific version of a contract, run the `get_specific_version.py` script.

```bash
python get_specific_version.py
```

## **Code Explanation**

### **1. `enable_versioning.py`**: Enable Versioning for the S3 Bucket

This script enables versioning on an S3 bucket, ensuring that every new upload creates a new version.


### **2. `upload_contract.py`**: Upload a New Contract

This script uploads legal contracts (e.g., NDAs, agreements) to the S3 bucket with versioning enabled.



### **3. `get_specific_version.py`**: Retrieve a Specific Version of a Contract

This script retrieves a specific version of a contract using the VersionId.



### **4. `list_versions.py`**: List All Versions of a Contract

This script lists all versions of a specific contract in the S3 bucket.

## **Further Improvements**
- **Contract Management System Integration**: Integrate with existing contract management systems for a seamless workflow.
- **Automated Notifications**: Set up notifications for when a new contract draft is available or a version is modified.

---

## **Conclusion**
The **Contract Evolution Manager** streamlines the process of managing contract versions by leveraging S3 versioning. Legal teams can track, compare, and ensure they are working with the latest contract version, reducing errors and improving efficiency.
